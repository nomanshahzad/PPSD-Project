Background: Online Bus Ticket Reservation System is a Web based application that works within a centralized network. This project presents a review on the software program "Online Bus Ticket Reservation System" as should be used in a bus transportation system, a facility which is used to reserve seats, cancellation of reservation and different types of route enquiries used on securing quick reservations.

Purpose:

OBTRS is built for managing and computerizing the traditional database, ticket booking and tracking bus and travel made. It maintains all customer details, bus details, reservation details

Statement of probl em: Currently, the type of system being used at the counter is an internal system which is manually used in selling the bus tickets. The problems facing the company are that customers have to go to the counter to buy bus ticket or ask for bus schedule, customers will also have to queue up for a long time in order to secure a bus ticket and will also need to pay cash when they buy the bus ticket.
